\title{A note about duplicate occurrence records}
\description{
BEWARE: spocc provides you a nice interface to many data providers for
species occurrence data. However, in cases where you request data from
GBIF \emph{in addition} to other data sources, there could be duplicate records.
This is because GBIF is, to use an ecology  analogy, a top predator, and
pulls in data from lower nodes in the food chain. For example, iNaturalist
provides data to GBIF, so if you search for occurrence records for
\emph{Pinus contorta} from iNaturalist and GBIF, you could get, for example,
20 of the same records.

We think a single R interface to many occurrence record providers
will provide a consistent way to work with occurrence data, making
analyses and vizualizations more repeatable across providers.

For cleaning data, see packages \code{scrubr}
() and \code{CoordinateCleaner}
()

Do get in touch with us if you have concerns, have ideas for eliminating
duplicates
